## Why ModKit?

ModKit is a Discord bot that provides the perfect balance of functionality and
bloat.  Most Discord bots have features upon features, and a lot of those
features are already built-in to Discord and remove space for creativity.

ModKit is different.  Built from the ground up to use Discord's latest
features and not reworked to implement them.  Completely open-source, written
in TypeScript with Discord.JS, and always getting updated.
